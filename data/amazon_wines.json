On the palate the wine is round and seamless, rich and supple, with great structure and nicely integrated tannins that promise a long life.    ORGANIC FARMING AT OUR VINEYARDS - After experimenting for several years with a few blocks of vines, in 2003 we decided to make the jump to the entire vineyard,\" says winery founder, Marimar Torres. \"The whole idea is to create an ideal balance between the vines and nature. The vineyard will be ecologically healthier, and the grapes of higher quality. That's our long-term reward.    Nestled in the rolling hills of western Sonoma County, the Russian River/Green Valley appellation is a perfect microclimate for growing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Only 10 miles from the Pacific Ocean and 50 miles north of San Francisco, the site is influenced by the seaâ€s cooling breezes and drifting fog. That is why Marimar Torres selected this privileged location to â€œexportâ€ the Torres family legacy of fine wines to California.",

These wines are sourced from the finest appellations in the Napa Valley including Oakville, Stags Leap, Carneros and other select vineyard sites. The wines blended together to create wines of complexity and elegance that come from working with the diversity of these vineyard sites.    Robert Mondavi established his namesake winery in 1966 with a vision to create Napa Valley wines that would stand in the company of the worldâ€s finest. He chose To Kalon Vineyard in the heart of the Napa Valley as the home for Robert Mondavi Winery. This first-growth vineyard, located in Oakville, California, is renowned for producing some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon wines in the world, as well as for its Sauvignon Blanc grapes, from which Mr. Mondavi crafted his signature wine, Fumé Blanc. Mr. Mondavi believed that wines should reflect their origins, that they are the product of the soil, the climate, and the careful stewardship of those precious resources. He also believed in combining the newest techniques and technology with time-honored winemaking traditions.",

Its well balanced, soft tannins make this wine a perfect accompaniment to a variety of foods, such as beef tenderloin, spaghetti bolognese, or aged gouda.    Winemaking - The Beringer winemaking team worked closely with the viticulture department to determine when each vineyard reached full maturity. Small amounts of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot were added for complexity and depth of flavors. Aging with seasoned French and American oak for five months added toastiness and hints of brown spice to the final blend.",

Golden yellow colour with green tints, limpid and brilliant, the nose exhibits exotic fruit aromas such as pineapple and mango which are conferred by the solar characteristic of this south-facing slope. There is also very mineral notes of blossoms.    Certified Organic    The Chapoutier family have been working in the Rhône valley since 1808. Starting as a simple grape grower Polydor Chapoutier, was the first to buy vines here and progressed to making and trading his own wine. In 1990 at the age of 26, Michel Chapoutier, a self-taught enthusiast and inquisitive visionary, took over the management of the estate, he brought with him a new approach and powerful ambition. He ushered in a new era for the winery, welcoming changes that link traditions of the past with his own daring convictions. Key to future success was Michelâ€s choice to break with past principles and prejudices. Recognising the unique flavours from the disparate plots (expressions of â€˜terroirâ€), within the vineyards of the hill of Hermitage, he decided to change the taste associated with Maison M. Chapoutier. He avoided cultivating a â€˜signature tasteâ€, focusing instead on communicating the numerous specific features of each terroir through a bio-dynamic approach.",

The small 4-hectare lot is home to Merlot vines planted in 1991. A wine that lends full expression to the Merlot variety. Fresh and elegant with sweet tannins. Remarkably long finish with a lovely lift of acidity.    SINGLE VINEYARD - Jean Leon wines were precursors of what we now call Single Vineyard Wines (Vi de Finca in Catalan). This designation, issued by the Catalan government, guarantees that the wine originates in a specific vineyard and displays a unique personality born from the interplay of the soil, the vines, the microclimate and the work carried out in the vineyard.    Jean Leon embarked upon his second great adventure: to create a wine that would bear his name, a unique and special wine to regale the palate of his dearest friends. For this venture, he needed to find the best land and climate, the best vines and finally, the best winemaking process. He travelled the world over in search of lands, until he reached Catalonia. There, in the heart of the Penedes region, he found the place that he sought. Jean Leon Purchased the current estate, composed of 150 hectares of chalky clay land, distributed along slightly sloping, south-facing hillside. When Jean Leon arrived in New York City, he worked as a cab driver. 3055 was his taxi license number, and it represents a look at the man behind the legend. The humble beginnings of an idealist who made his dreams a reality.",
